## Flexibility and Iteration

This timeline represents our current best understanding of the work ahead. As with any complex project, we expect to learn and adapt as we progress.

Weekly check-ins will allow us to assess progress, identify blockers, and adjust priorities as needed. The phased approach ensures that we deliver working functionality at each stage, rather than waiting until the end to validate our work.

Our goal is not just to complete features, but to deliver a system we are confident in.
