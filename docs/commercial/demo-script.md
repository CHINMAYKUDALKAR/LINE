## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have an ATS"
> "Lineup complements your ATS. Most ATS platforms have limited scheduling. Lineup handles scheduling, communication, and coordination—then syncs back."

### "Can we do this in Google Calendar?"
> "Google Calendar doesn't track candidates, can't see interviewer preferences, and doesn't have communication history. Lineup gives you the full picture."

### "Is our data secure?"
> "Yes. Encryption at rest and in transit. SOC 2 aligned practices. SSO available on Enterprise. Audit logs on all actions."

### "Can we customize it?"
> "Email templates are fully customizable. Roles and permissions configurable. API available for Pro and Enterprise."

### "What about video interviews?"
> "Lineup doesn't include video—we integrate with your existing video tool (Zoom, Teams, etc.). We focus on scheduling, not replacing video."
