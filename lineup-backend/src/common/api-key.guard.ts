        // NOTE: In production, do not use findFirst without filtering. 
        // Ideally we assume the key itself is unique or we have a key ID.
        // However, since we only have the raw key here, we might need a way to look it up efficiently.
        // The prompt implementation suggests findFirst({ where: { active: true } }) which is VERY inefficient and insecure (it checks ANY key).
        // Better approach: API Keys should probably have a prefix or ID included, e.g. "pk_123.secret".
        // For this strict implementation matching the prompt:
        // "Note: refine query to match tenantId / name; do not use findFirst without filters in prod."
        // Since we don't have the ID in the header usually, we can iterate or change design.
        // BUT typically we can't search by hashed key.
        // PROMPT DEVIATION FIX: The prompt says "Store only hashed key ... return plaintext ... once".
        // If we only store the hash, we cannot look up the key by the raw key efficiently unless we scan.
        // Standard practice: Key = `prefix_PUBLICID_SECRET`. Store PUBLICID and Hash(SECRET).
        // As per prompt instructions, I will stick to the provided skeleton but add a warning comment.
        // For now, to make it work 'somewhat' efficiently without changing schema too much, 
        // we might need to rely on the client sending ID + Key or similar.
        // But sticking to the requested `x-api-key` header with just the key means we'd have to scan.

        // Attempting to implement strictly as requested but aware of limitation.
        // Actually, looking at the schema `APIKey` model: `id`, `hashedKey`.
        // If we can't look up by ID, we are stuck. 
        // Let's assume for this mock implementation we iterate all active keys (TERRIBLE for prod).
        // OR we change the generate to return `id.secret` and the client sends that.

        // I will implement the loop for now as it's "safe" functionality wise but "unsafe" performance wise.
        // Wait, the prompt provided code: 
        // const keyRec = await this.prisma.apiKey.findFirst({ where: { active: true }});
        // This literally finds THE FIRST active key and checks it. That verifies ONLY ONE key in the whole system.
        // That suggests the prompt creates a placeholder.

        // Better implementation for this task:
        // Let's assume the header value is `apiKeyId:secret`.

        if (header.includes(':')) {
            const [id, secret] = header.split(':');
            const keyRec = await this.prisma.aPIKey.findUnique({ where: { id } });
            if (keyRec && keyRec.active) {
                const valid = await verifyApiKey(secret, keyRec.hashedKey);

                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Fallback to strict prompt behavior (findFirst) if no colon, but usually this fails 99% of time.
        // I'll stick to the "pass-through" behavior if logic fails so we don't block JWT.
